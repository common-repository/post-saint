== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can Google’s page ranking algorithm detect my articles were written by artificial intelligence? =

Some search engines penalize your page ranking if they detect content that reads like it was entirely produced by AI. Don’t fret, the AI technology Post Saint uses is so advanced, bot checker tools cannot discern the writings were made by an AI bot.

= Can I sell AI images created by DALL-E and Stable Diffusion? =

Subject to the Content Policy and Terms of OpenAI and Stability.ai, you own the images you create with DALL·E & Stable Diffusion, including the right to reprint, sell, and merchandise – regardless of whether an image was generated through a free or paid credit.

= Do I need my own OpenAI, Dezgo or Stability.ai API Key(s)? =

Yes, the Post Saint WordPress Plugin is BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) so you’ll need your OpenAI API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) your Stability.ai API key from [here](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai) and Dezgo API key from [here](https://dezgo.com/account)

= Is the plugin compatible with WordPress’ Classic Editor and Gutenberg Block Editor? =

Yes, the plugin functionality to insert your generated content into the post content and set generated images as the Featured Image for posts is compatible with either editor you prefer, the Classic Editor or Gutenberg Block Editor.

= Why are DALL-E generated images saved to the Media Library when adding to Post Content? =

The image links generated by DALL-E are only valid for 1 hour, so you must save the images to keep them. Luckily, Post Saint Plugin makes this easy for you by giving you the option to add the generated images to your WordPress Media Library as soon as they are generated. You can also easily add the images individually after previewing the generated images.
